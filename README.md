# Youds Framework
Youds Framework is a powerful MVC application with a highly extensible feature set.

Based on Agavi and intended to give more features using Agavi's extensibility, Youds Framework is ideal for those wanting Agavi pimped. 

# More on Agavi
Agavi is a general purpose PHP application framework built around the Model-View-Controller architecture originally based on the Mojavi 3 Web application framework written by Sean Kerr. It provides a rich toolset that solves most of the routine problems in Web application development.

Agavi is designed for serious development. It is not a complete website construction kit but rather a skeleton over which you build your application. The architecture of Agavi allows developers to retain very fine control over their code. Agavi itself is written to be extensible, and powerful. Whereas this documentation serves as an important resource, many developers are comfortable learning from Agavi's source code.

Agavi strives to leave most implementational choices to the developers. Agavi's components are inherently extensible, and the framework itself is designed around a XML-based configuration system that provides a very flexible environment. For you — as a developer — this architectural style means that you are required to perform less hacking (or, in most cases, none at all!) at the framework level and therefore have more time to get your application written.

The framework works for almost all kinds of applications but excels most in large codebases, long-term projects, extreme cases of integration and other special situations.

# More on Youds Framework
A fork of Agavi, Youds Framework uses Agavi's extensibility to put in place features such as:
 - Spam Bot Prevention
 - Additional Form Features
 - 404 URL Checker
 - Output Console For Development Work 
 - Dwoo Templating Engine

*Please note: these features are in the pipeline, the actual feature set is a renamed Agavi as Youds Framework with some comment fixes needed.*
